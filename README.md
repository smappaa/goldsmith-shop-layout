# Goldsmith shop layout
The Smappaa Ltd is an imaginary goldsmith & watchmaker shop, which needed a responsive one-page website. In this project I am practicing creating a semantic and responsive website from scratch without frameworks.

There's quite a lot of newer CSS3 techniques and trickery put in place to achieve an appearance that I'm happy with.
